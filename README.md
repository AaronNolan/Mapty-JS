Course Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

## Description
This project uses a geolocation API to display a map with the users current location. It allows the user to select a point on the map to represent where they completed a workout and allows them record:

* The type of workout
* The distance
* The duration
* The elevation or speed depending on the type of workout

It makes use of local storage so that the user can return to the application at a later time and it will still contain their previous workouts.
